# DualChatAI

DualChatAI is an AI-powered chat system that uses the Groq API for all responses.  
To use it, you only need an API key from the official Groq website.

## How It Works
1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com) and sign in or create an account.  
2. Generate your API key from your Groq dashboard.  
3. In DualChatAI settings, enter your key in one or both fields:
   - AI Model V1 API Key  
   - AI Model V2 API Key  
4. You can use either one or both fields. A single valid key is enough for the system to work.
